Data Structures and Algorithms Repository
Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms Repository! This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Python, along with exercises aimed at understanding these concepts better.

Class Structures
The repository includes well-organized class structures for fundamental data structures such as:

Doubly Linked List: Implementation of a doubly linked list with methods for appending, popping, prepending, popping the first element, inserting at a specific index, removing at a specific index, and more.
Linked List: Implementation of a singly linked list with methods for appending, popping, prepending, popping the first element, inserting at a specific index, removing at a specific index, and additional functionalities such as finding the middle node and detecting loops.
Binary Tree: Basic implementation of a binary tree with methods for insertion, traversal (inorder, preorder, and postorder), searching for a node, finding the height, and checking if the tree is balanced.
Binary Search Tree: Implementation of a binary search tree with methods for insertion, deletion, searching for a node, finding the minimum and maximum nodes, and checking if the tree is balanced.
Heap: Implementation of a binary heap (min-heap) with methods for insertion, deletion, and heapification.
Queue: Implementation of a queue using arrays with methods for enqueue, dequeue, peek, and checking if the queue is empty.
Stack: Implementation of a stack using arrays with methods for push, pop, peek, and checking if the stack is empty.
#This repo is updated as class structures are created.
